 I'll read an extract of an assignment. A Welch t-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are for the maze 3-3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze 5-5, H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Dynacue is more efficient. So figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds indicating occasions of error bounds. Maze 8-8, H0 is rejected with 87% confidence. Dynacue is more efficient with narrower errors bounds in figure 1. Dynacue demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger mazes. For smaller mazes, its advantage diminishes due to the minimal real interactions required.
