 I read a list of assignments. A watch contest was conducted to prepare some of our fishing shore with the no hypothesis H0 stating that the main steps to convergence are equal for both modes. The results are Main's Super 3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical main steps for both modes. Main's 5 to 5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. DLQ is more efficient, so figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicated in cashier comparable performance by Q-Learning. Main's 8 Brains, H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. DLQ is more efficient, with no error bounds in video 1. DLQ demonstrates super simple efficiency, particularly in larger ranges. For smaller ranges, it's advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions to the clients.
