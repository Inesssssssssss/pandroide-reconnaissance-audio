 I'll read an extra of an assignment. A WALCH T-TEST was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the min steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are, Maze 3x3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical min steps for both models. Maze 5x5 H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Tynacue is more efficient, so figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating questionable performance by cure learning. Maze 8x8 H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Tynacue is more efficient, with narrow error bounds in figure 1. Tynacue demonstrates sample efficiency, particularly in larger mazes. For smaller mazes, it's advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
