 I'll read an extract of an assignment. A Walsh t-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are Maze 3x3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze 5x5 H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. DynaQ is more efficient so Figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds indicating questionable comparable performance by Q-learning. Maze 8x8 H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. DynaQ is more efficient with narrow error bounds in Figure 1. DynaQ demonstrates superior sample efficiency particularly in larger Mases. For smaller Mazes it's advantage can be created by increasing mightily increased survival rate, weighing resistance to L2 in other estimates. We are very close to 100% when it comes to Bangles' comfort baths. For smaller mises its advantage can be found in the results of cannot be expected changes to match our models regardless of here factors. diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
