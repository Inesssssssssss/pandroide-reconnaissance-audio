 I read an extra of an assignment. A Walsh t-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0, stating that the mean steps to competence are equal for both models. The results are MACE Super 3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. MACE 5.5 H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. TinyQ is more efficient, so Figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating national comparable performance by Q-Learning. MACE 8.8 H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. TinyQ is more efficient, with narrow error bounds in Figure 1. TinyQ demonstrates severe sample efficiency, particularly in larger regions. H0 raises its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
