 I'll read an extra of an assignment. A Walsh t-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0, stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are Mace 3x3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Mace 5x5 H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Dyno Q is more efficient, so figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating additional comparable performance by cure learning. Mace 8x8 H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Dyno Q is more efficient, with narrower error bounds in figure 1. Dyno Q demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger mazes. For smaller mazes, its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
