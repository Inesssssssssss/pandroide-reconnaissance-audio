 I read an extra of an assignment. A Walsh t-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are Maze super 3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze 5x5 H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. DynoQ is more efficient, so figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating occasional comparable performance by cure learning. Maze 8x8 H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. DynoQ is more efficient, with lower error bounds in figure 1. DynoQ demonstrates severe sample efficiency, particularly in larger mazes. For smaller mazes, its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
