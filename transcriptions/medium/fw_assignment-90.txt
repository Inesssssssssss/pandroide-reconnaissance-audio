 I read an extra of an assignment. A watch-t test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to competence are equal for both models. The results are Maze super 3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze 5 to 5 H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Dyno Q is more efficient, so figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating additional comparable performance by cure learning. Maze 8 to 8 H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Dyno Q is more efficient, with lower error bounds in figure 1. Dyno Q demonstrates severe sample efficiency, particularly in larger regions. For smaller regions, its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
