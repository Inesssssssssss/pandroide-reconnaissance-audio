 A read and extract of an assignment. A watched T-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both means. The results are, mains super3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both means. Maze 5.5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. TinyQ is more efficient, so figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating national comparable performance by Q-learning. Maze 8.8. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. TinyQ is more efficient, with null error bounds in figure 1. TinyQ demonstrates severe sample efficiency, particularly in larger ranges. For smaller ranges, it's advantageous the range used to minimize real interactions to the client.
