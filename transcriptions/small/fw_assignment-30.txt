 I'll read an extra of an assignment. A Welch T-test was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are, mains 3x3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze 5x5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. TinoQ is more efficient, so Figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating rational comparable performance by cure learning. Maze 8x8. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. TinoQ is more efficient, with narrower error bounds in Figure 1. TinoQ demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger mazes. For smaller mazes, its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions required.
