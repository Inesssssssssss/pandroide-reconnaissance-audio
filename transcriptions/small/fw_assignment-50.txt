 I'll read an extra of an assignment. A WALCH steepest was conducted to compare some efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are, mains super3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. This is 5 per 5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. TINUQ is more efficient, so Figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating national comparable performance by cure learning. Maze 8 per 8. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. TINUQ is more efficient, with narrow error bounds in figure 1. TINUQ demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger raises. For smaller raises, its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions to the client.
