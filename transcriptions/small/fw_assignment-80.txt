 I'll read an extra of an assignment. A watch steepest was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both means. The results are, mains super3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both means. Maze 5-5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Tiny Q is more efficient. So figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating national comparable performance by cure learning. Maze 8-8. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Tiny Q is more efficient, with narrow error bounds in figure 1. Tiny Q demonstrates severe sample efficiency, particularly in larger ranges. For smaller ranges, it's advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions to the client.
