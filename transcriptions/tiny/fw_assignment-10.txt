 I read an excerpt of an assignment. A watchtidest was conducted to prepare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are, Maze3 per 3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Fe1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze5 per 5, H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Tynocule is more efficient, so figure one shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating questionable comparable performance by curlerening. Maze8 per 8, H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Tynocule is more efficient with narrow error bounds in figure one. Tynocule demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger Mazes. For smaller Mazes, it advantage diminishes due to minimal, real interactions to required.
