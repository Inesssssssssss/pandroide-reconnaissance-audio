 I read the master of the assignment and watched the desk was conducted to refer some of the official sure to the null hypothesis H3 stating that the manuscripts of the victims are therefore forgotten. The results are, May 23, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of the problems. The year one shows non-identical mistakes of all the others. May 25, H0 is rejected with 90% of the problems. The year two is more efficient. The year one shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicates the intentional comparable performance by clearly. May's ignorance, H0 is rejected with 87% of the problems. The year two is more efficient. With no error bounds, it's a new one. Then we can illustrate several sample efficiency, particularly in larger equations. For smaller sizes, it's advantage to reach its root minimum. You'll know interactions to the client.
