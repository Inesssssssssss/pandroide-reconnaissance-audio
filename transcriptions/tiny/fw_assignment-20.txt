 I read an excerpt of an assignment. A watched test was conducted to prepare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are, mains 3% 3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze 5.5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Dynamic U is more efficient. So, figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicating questionable comparable performance by Q learning. Maze 8.8. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Dynamic U is more efficient with narrow error bounds in figure 1. Dynamic U demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger mazes. For smaller mazes, it advantage diminishes due to minimal, real interactions to required.
