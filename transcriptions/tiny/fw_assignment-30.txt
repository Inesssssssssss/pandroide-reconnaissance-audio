 A read and extra of an assignment. A watch device was conducted to prepare sample efficiency with the no hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are, mains, 3 per 3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Figure 1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. Maze, 5 per 5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Tynocule is more efficient. So figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicating questionable comparable performance by clearly. Maze, 8 per 8. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Tynocule is more efficient with narrow error bounds in figure 1. Then if you demonstrate super sample efficiency, particularly in larger Maze's. For smaller Maze's, it advantage diminishes due to minimal, real interactions to required.
