 A read and extra of an assignment. A watch device was conducted to prepare sample efficiency with the no hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are May's Super 3-H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. The year one shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. May's 5-5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. The NQ is more efficient. So figure one shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicating Casional Comparable Performance by Cue Learning. May's A Parade. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. The NQ is more efficient with narrow error bounds in figure one. The NQ demonstrates the various sample efficiency, particularly in larger sizes. For smaller sizes, it's advantage diminishes due to minimal, real interactions to required.
