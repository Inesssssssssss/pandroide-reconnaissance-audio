 Are we a master of an assignment or watch the desk was conducted to prepare some efficiency with the no hypothesis H0 stating that the main steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are Main Super3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. The year one shows nearly identical means steps for both models. Main 5.5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. The LQ is more efficient. So figure one shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicating does not comparable performance by clearly. Main 8.8.8.8 is rejected with 87% of confidence. The LQ is more efficient with now error bounds if you want. The LQ demonstrates a very simple efficiency, particularly in larger races. For smaller races, its advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions to required.
