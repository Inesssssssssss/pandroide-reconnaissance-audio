 Are we in the start of an assignment? A watch today was conducted to prepare some of the official sure if the null hypothesis H0 stating that the main steps to convergence are important for both of them. The results are Mays Super 3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. The year 1 shows nearly identical means steps for both of them. Mays 5.5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. The LQ is more efficient. So figure 1 shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicating does not comparable performance by clearly. Mays April 8th. H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. The LQ is more efficient. With now error bounds in video 1. The LQ demonstrates the various number of efficiency, particularly in larger regions. For smaller sizes it's advantage to manage its due to minimal real interactions to the client.
