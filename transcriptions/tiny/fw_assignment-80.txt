 I read the master of the assignment and watched the desk was conducted to repair some of the official sure that the null hypothesis H0 stating that the manuscripts to the victims are above or above the list. The results are Mays Super 3, H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of performance. The year one shows nearly identical means that football remains. Mays 5.5. H0 is rejected with 90% of performance. The LQ is more efficient. So figure one shows some overlap in error bounds. Indicating does not comparable performance by clearly. Mays 8.8.8.0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. The LQ is more efficient. We now error bounds if you want. The LQ demonstrates the very simple efficiency, particularly in larger regions. For smaller sizes, it's advantage to reach its due to minimal real interactions to the quiet.
