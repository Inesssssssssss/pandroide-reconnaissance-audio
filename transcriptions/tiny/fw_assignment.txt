 I'll read an extra of an assignment. A watched detest was conducted to compare sample efficiency with the null hypothesis H0 stating that the mean steps to convergence are equal for both models. The results are May's 3.3 H0 cannot be rejected with 90% of confidence. Fe-1 shows nearly identical mean steps for both models. May's 5.5. H0 is rejected with 95% of confidence. Dynamic U is more efficient, so figure one shows some overlap in error bounds, indicating questionable comparable performance by cure learning. May's 8.8, H0 is rejected with 87% of confidence. Dynamic U is more efficient with narrow error bounds in figure one. Dynamic U demonstrates superior sample efficiency, particularly in larger phases. For smaller phases, it's advantage diminishes due to minimal real interactions through quiet.
